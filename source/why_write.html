    <h2>Why Write?</h2>
    <p>Communicate your work to other people.</p>
    <blockquote style="font-size:75%" cite="http://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/writing-scientific-papers-14239285">
      &ldquo;Many scientific papers fail to usefully communicate research work to their audience. They focus on the authors instead of on the readers by failing to clarify the motivation for the work or by including unnecessary details. Or they try to impress the readers rather than inform them. As a result, they are interesting to or understandable by only a small set of highly specialized readers. Effective scientific papers, in contrast, are interesting and useful to many readers, including newcomers to the field.&rdquo;
